# Hello-World
Hopefully a beginners paced but informative test repository, I'm very curious so please feel free to help me out a 'Newbie'.


Hello, Github community,
The name's Sean!

I really hope I manage to pick this up over time,
Seems like it could be a pretty interesting hobbie.

It would also be great to not have to keep flashing
my filmware since "If it doesn't make sense, it must
be cool enough for Super-user rights and root access".

I'm going to look forward to working together with this,
community,

Thanks guys.
